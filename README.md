I am a dedicated design professional with a background in art and architecture and a burgeoning experience in web development. Driven by the curiosity to translate my design skills in the tech industry, my pursued self-study in computer programming led me to enrolling in Nashville Software School. At NSS, I am gaining the real world practice and application of contemporary languages and frameworks such as JavaScript, React, Python and Django. The best part of my experience in NSS is having the ability to collaborate on real projects with my cohort. The insight and perspective that I gain from my fellow classmates has encouraged and inspired my journey in web development even further.
